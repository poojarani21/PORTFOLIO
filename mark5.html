    <h1>Categories of indian family</h1>      
    <p>
      Socity is devided family into three classes. on the top are the reach. They are the people who
      have got everything in plenty,their standard of leaving is high. They are in dominating position 
      every where. They have also upper hand in industrial and economic circle of the contry.        
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom poor people are there. The people who are in below proverty line. Some people have
      no house to live in. Many of them are spending their night in footpath,also they are getting 
      meals hardly two times. They are generally doing labour work.They are earning little money which is 
      insuficent to fulfill their all ecential requrement, threr children  are not getting well education 
      due to proverty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a middle class between top and bottom. They are just managing the requrement of the family.
      They are nither reacdh nor poor.There condition is slightly better than that of the poor people.
      They are having atleast small houses to live in. In middile class family peopleare not in good condition
      for money,but they never want show to their children that they are earning money by doing hard work.
      They always try to give better education and other requrementof their children.   
    </p>
    <p>
      eople of middle class are generally educated and are consicious for the education of their children.
      At the end the middle class family is still happiest one day.
